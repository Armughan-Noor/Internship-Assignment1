      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>Hypertext Markup Language revision 5 (HTML5) is markup language for the structure and presentation of World Wide Web contents. HTML5 supports the traditional HTML and XHTML-style syntax and other new features in its markup, New APIs, XHTML and error handling.</p>
      <h5>There are three organizations that are currently in charge of the specification of HTML5:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) created the HTML5 specification and is in charge of the HTML5 development that provides open collaboration of browser vendors and other involved parties.</p></li>
        <li><p>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is in charge with delivering the HTML5 specification.</p></li>
        <li><p>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is in charge of the development of HTML5 WebSocket API.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>(Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple 
        syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.In the Introduction to HTML module, 
        we covered what HTML is and how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in 
        a web browser. Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have 
        space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish them from the rest of the text. 
        What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser applies 
        to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically readable even if no explicit styling is specified 
        by the author of the page.
      </p>
      <h5>CSS rules</h5>
      <ul>
        <li><p>The CSS rule opens with a selector. This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. 
            In this case, we are styling level one headings (h1).We then have a set of curly braces { }.</p></li>
        <li><p>Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. 
            We specify the property (color in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value of the 
            property after the colon</p></li>
        <li><p>Two declarations, one for color and the other for font-size. Each pair 
            specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting , then a value that we'd 
            like to give the property.</p></li>
      </ul>

    <section class="Container-JavaScript" id="javaScript">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on 
            web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for 
            you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, 
            scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third 
            layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered 
            in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
        </p>
        <h5>What can it really do?</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to 
            be entered then store that name in a variable called name.</p></li>
          <li><p>Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take 
            the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. 
            "Player 1: Chris".</p></li>
          <li><p>Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in 
            our example above to detect when the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>REACTJS</h2>
        <p>As its official tagline states, React is a library for
           building user interfaces. React is not a framework
           it's not even exclusive to the web. It's used with 
           other libraries to render to certain environments. 
           For instance, React Native can be used to build mobile
           applications. To build for the web, developers use React
           in tandem with ReactDOM. React and ReactDOM are often 
           discussed in the same spaces as — and utilized to solve 
           the same problems as — other true web development 
           frameworks. When we refer to React as a "framework", 
           we're working with that colloquial understanding.
        </p>
        <h5>Initializing your React app</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Installs some npm packages essential to the functionality of the app.</p></li>
          <li><p>Writes scripts for starting and serving the application.</p></li>
          <li><p>Creates a structure of files and directories that define the basic app architecture.</p></li>
          <li><p>Initializes the directory as a git repository, if you have git installed on your computer.</p></li>
        </ul>
